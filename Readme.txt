Web-Based Resume Generator

Project Overview

This project is a web-based resume generator developed during my Bachelor's in Software Engineering in 2022. The application allows users to input their personal and professional details, which are then dynamically formatted into a well-structured resume.

Features

Interactive Form: Users can fill in various fields such as personal information, education, work experience, and skills.

Dynamic Resume Preview: The input data is instantly reflected on the resume page, allowing users to see real-time updates.

Customizable Sections: Users can manually add more sections (e.g., additional work experiences or skills) using JavaScript, which builds the logic for dynamic content addition.


Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual presentation of the resume generator.
JavaScript: For implementing the core logic, including:
Dynamically moving data from the input form to the resume preview.
Adding additional data tiles (e.g., work experiences, skills) as needed.
